# Firestore Rules — v6.0

   ## New Hierarchy:
   - **HEAD** (Head Sub Branches) — full control
   - **VICE** — full control
   - **HEAD_HR_GLOBAL** — global HR
   - **PRESIDENT / VICE_PRESIDENT** — per team
   - **HEAD_HR_TEAM** — team HR head
   - **HR** — per team HR
   - **COMMITTEE_HR** — per committee HR

   ## 3-Stage Approval Flow:
   1. **Committee HR** — assigns points flexibly (mandatory)
   2. **Team Head HR OR Team Head** (one of them, first wins)
   3. **Head HR Global OR Head OR Vice** (one of them, first wins)

   After stage 3 → auto points award → notification → league update.

   ## Publish:
   Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → paste → Publish
